# What does it do

## primary concerns

- Fetch or update
- Caching (isn't easy)
- backend agnostic: FETCH, graphQL and anything that returns a promise

## Secondary concerns

- deduce multiple requests to one
- window focus refetching and tapping into the event
- know and update out of date data
- performance optimizations
- Dev experience: less number of lines remove complexity of code
- Garbage collection / memory
