# What is it

## Primary usecases

- hooks for fetching and updating asynchronous data

- caching

- backend agnostic: `fetch`, `graphQL` or anything that returns a promise

## Secondary usecases

- query retries with incremental delay

- know and update out of date data

- performance optimizations

- Dev experience: less number of lines remove complexity of code

- Garbage collection / memory

- deduce multiple requests to one

- window focus refetching and tapping into the event
