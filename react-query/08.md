# With Next.js and SSR

Some mechanism is required to gather the data loaded on the server in order to send it to the client for hydration.

## Hydrating the render on client side

### The classic model for SSR is

**Server-side**: Load all data required for page asynchronously

**Server-side**: Pass data into React app and render synchronously

**Send to client**: Rendered HTML + data as JSON

**Client-side**: Browser renders static HTML initially

**Client-side**: Once all components and data required are loaded, "hydrate" the page using ReactDOM.hydrate()
