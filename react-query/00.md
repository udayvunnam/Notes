# Server State vs UI State

> ðŸ’¡React query aids the concept of separating UI state vs server state

- UI State: synchronous (menu, UI selection, toasts etc)
- Server State: asynchronous(orders, orderDetails etc)

- Even though we were using redux state earlier we used to keep server state in part of the store and UI state was kept in different part of the store.
- In redux often the async logic has been supproted by thunks, sagas, observables
- Each of the async call comes with initiate, success, failure, loading, cache. redux logic usually been bloated.

## Bloated with Redux with mixed usage

## Usage

- config at global and query-level
- ReactQueryConfigProvider takes the value for global context of react-query
