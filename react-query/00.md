# Server State vs UI State

> React query helps in the concept of separating UI state vs server state

- UI State: synchronous (menu, UI selection, toasts etc)

- Server State: asynchronous(orders, orderDetails etc)

- With redux state we used to keep server state in part of the store and UI state was kept in different part of the store.

- In redux often the async logic has been supproted by thunks, sagas, observables etc

- Each of the async call comes with initiate, success, failure, loading, cache.

- Redux logic was usually been bloated handling server state.
