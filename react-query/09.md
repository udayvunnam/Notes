# With Next.js and SSR

- some mechanism is required to gather the data loaded on the server in order to send it to the client for hydration.

## Hydrating the render on client side

### The classic model for SSR is

**Server-side**: Load all data required for page asynchronously

**Server-side**: Pass data into React app and render synchronously

**Send to client**: Rendered HTML + data as JSON

**Client-side**: Browser renders static HTML initially

**Client-side**: Once all components and data required are loaded, "hydrate" the page using ReactDOM.hydrate()

### With async SSR, the server-side process is different

**Server-side**: Asynchronously render React app

**Server-side**: Data loaded asynchronously during render
(remaining steps same as above)

### The advantages of this change are

- Components define their own data needs
- No need for data dependencies to be "hoisted" to the page's root component
- Therefore, components are less tightly coupled (the React way!)
