# Serial(dependent) Queries

- Parallel by default

- Searial(dependant) queries need to specify `enabled` flag

```jsx
// Get the user
const { data: user } = useQuery(["user", email], getUserByEmail);

// Then get the user's projects
const { isIdle, isLoading, idFetching, data: projects } = useQuery(
  ["projects", user.id],
  getProjectsByUser,
  {
    // `user` would be `null` at first (falsy),
    // so the query will not execute until the user exists
    enabled: user,
  }
);

// isIdle will be `true` until `enabled` is true and the query begins to fetch.
// It will then go to the `isLoading` stage and hopefully the `isSuccess` stage :)
```

## isLoading vs isFetching

- `isLoading: true` for initial mounting period before query is resolved

- `isFetching: true && isLoading: false` for successive renders when data is fetched in background. Even though it fetches in background there wont be a loading state

- Rather it fetches and compares to previous data and avoids additional render if data didn't change
