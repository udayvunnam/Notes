# Stale Time and Cache Time

- **staleTime**: Query results that are currently rendered on the screen (via useQuery and similar hooks) will become "stale" immediately after they are resolved and will be refetched automatically in the background when they are rendered or used again

```jsx
  // default staleTime is 0
  <ReactQueryConfigProvider config={{ queries: { staleTime: 60000 } }} >
```

- **cacheTime**: Query results that become unused (all instances of the query are unmounted) will still be cached in case they are used again for a default of 5 minutes before they are garbage collected.

- **query retries**: 3 times, with exponential backoff delay

- **How it avoids re-renders when data isn't changed**: Query results by default are deep compared to detect if data has actually changed and if not, the data reference remains unchanged to better help with value stabilization with regards to useMemo and useCallback.
