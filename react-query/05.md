# Caching

- In memory cache, it's not persisted in local storage. So every refresh we loose the cache and that's same for any cache. How cache is handled can be overwritten by `ReactQueryCacheProvider`
- default cache time is 5 min
- It uses a stale-while-revalidate caching strategy. SWR is popular among request headers and browser deciding on the cache strategy for static assets
- the data will be refetched and the cache revalidated.
- default stale time is 0
- Here react query takes two params staleTime, cacheTime that take the SWR pattern
