# Caching and queryCache

- In memory cache, it's not persisted in local storage. So every refresh we loose the cache and that's same for any cache.

- Cache handling can be overwritten by `ReactQueryCacheProvider`.

## Cache strategy: stale-while-revalidate

swr in general indicates that the client will accept a stale response, while asynchronously checking in the background for a fresh one

`Cache-Control: public,max-age=86400,stale-while-revalidate=300`

- the data will be refetched and the cache revalidated between `cacheTime & cacheTime+staleTime` if a resource is requested.

- Defaults: `cacheTime: 5 min, staleTime: 0`
